Each month the community will have the opportunity to sign up to attend a Google Hangouts presentation over lunch (12:00PM east coast time). The tone for these is casual, welcoming, and encouraging. The host is able to present for up to 30 minutes and determine whether they would like to take questions and where (live versus in the #lunchlearn channel as a follow-up).

These may also be recorded in the future if the host is comfortable with that as we understand not everyone has consistent or flexible lunch time each day.

### Hosting

If you are interested in hosting a Lunch & Learn [fill out a brief form](https://docs.google.com/a/elaconf.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfnpFqVMdUsdoQT-qOsKOx3wdGwh94T7qV8XAv5piW2PA7Prg/viewform) and we will be in touch!

### Attending

Each Lunch & Learn will have its own sign up form that will be shared in advance in Slack, on Twitter, and within the event details in the calendar.

Also, feel free to join the #lunchlearn channel in Slack to better capture questions that you may not get a chance to ask during the presentation.

### Sponsoring

We have opportunities for companies to sponsor these events, gaining recognition as a supporter with mentions of company name and logo on presentation promo materials, social media, and in our calendar. These funds also help secure any relevant books that would make for appropriate attendee giveaways for certain topics.

For those looking to really join and engage with the community we also offer the opportunity for a woman employee to host a Lunch & Learn. Please note that we require that presentations focus on sharing knowledge and experiences rather than direct company or product promotion; we‚Äôll be posting more details about various partnership opportunities this month üéÅ
